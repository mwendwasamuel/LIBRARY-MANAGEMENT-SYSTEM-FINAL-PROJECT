**Library Management System (LMS) README**
*****Problem Statement*****

Many libraries face challenges in efficiently managing their book collections and serving their patrons. Traditional manual systems can be time-consuming and error-prone, leading to suboptimal library operations. There is a need for a modern Library Management System (LMS) that can streamline library processes, enhance user experiences, and provide effective book tracking.
Solution

We propose the development of a Library Management System (LMS) that leverages modern web technologies. This LMS will provide librarians with powerful tools for cataloging, tracking, and managing library resources. It will also offer patrons a user-friendly interface to search for books, check their availability, and manage their borrowed items. The system will ensure data accuracy, security, and access control for different user roles (librarians, patrons, administrators).
MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP for our Library Management System (LMS) will focus on the core features necessary to demonstrate the system's functionality and value.
Backend
User Authentication:

    Implement user registration for librarians and patrons.
    Implement secure login functionality using hashed and salted passwords.
    Develop a password recovery/reset mechanism for forgotten passwords, involving email verification.

User Roles and Access Control:

    Create three user roles: Librarian, Patron, Administrator.
    Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions based on user roles.
    Allow administrators to manage user accounts, roles, and privileges.

Book Management:

    Develop APIs for librarians to add new books to the system with details like title, author, ISBN, and category.
    Enable librarians to mark books as available, checked out, or overdue.
    Create APIs for patrons to search for books by title, author, or category.
    Implement APIs for patrons to view book details, including availability status.

Transaction Tracking:

    Build transaction tracking functionality to record checkouts and returns.
    Enable librarians to check out books to patrons and check them back in upon return.
    Develop APIs for patrons to view their transaction history, including due dates.

Data Security:

    Implement secure password storage by hashing and salting user passwords.
    Ensure proper access control to prevent unauthorized actions based on user roles.

Validation and Error Handling:

    Implement data validation for user inputs in registration forms, book information, and other relevant areas.
    Provide appropriate error messages and feedback to users for invalid actions or input.

Frontend
User Authentication:

    Create user registration forms for librarians and patrons.
    Design secure login screens with password recovery/reset options.

User Roles and Access Control:

    Design user interfaces that reflect the different roles and their corresponding permissions.
    Implement role-based navigation and actions.

Book Management:

    Develop user interfaces for librarians to add new books with necessary details.
    Create a book search feature for patrons to search by title, author, or category.
    Design book detail pages for patrons to view availability status.

Transaction Tracking:

    Design transaction history screens for patrons to view their checkouts and due dates.
    Provide librarians with interfaces to perform check-in and check-out operations.

User-Friendly Interface:

    Design clean and intuitive user interfaces for both librarians and patrons.
    Ensure responsive design to support various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    Implement smooth navigation between different sections of the LMS.

Validation and Error Handling:

    Implement client-side validation for user inputs to prevent submission of invalid data.
    Display user-friendly error messages and feedback for invalid actions or input.
